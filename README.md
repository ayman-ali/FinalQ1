In this project, I used Monte Carlo integration to calculate the volume of super-ellipsoids in 5-dimensional space, such that the error estimations were less than .03. 

Included in this program is;

- A makefile to control the entire project
- A graph of the volume of the superellipsoids vs. the parameter n.

The calculations made sense, and matched clearly with our predictions.
